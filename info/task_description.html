    Do you know how to play in Prime Palindrome Golf?
    You are given a number and you should find the closest palindromic prime number that greater than the given.
</p>


<p>
    A palindromic number or numeral palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
    Like 79197, for example, it is "symmetrical".<br>
    A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
    In this task you will be given an positive integer.
    You should find the closest integer that:<br>
    - is greater than the given number;<br>
    - is prime;<br>
    - is palindromic.<br>
    For example, the number is 13 and the closest greater palindromic prime is 131.
    One more example, the number is 2 and the answer is 3, because any one-digit number is a palindrome.

<p>
    And one more rule.
    This is a <strong>code golf mission</strong> and your main goal to make your code as short as possible.
    The shorter your code, the more points you earn.
    Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code.
    For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used.
    250 characters is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points.
    For each character less than 250, you earn 1 point. For example for 200 character long code earns you 50 points.
</p>
<p><strong>Input: </strong> A number as an integer.</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The closest greater palindromic prime as an integer.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">
golf(2) == 3
golf(13) == 101
golf(101) == 131
</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Prime numbers are very useful for many CS areas.
    But this task is not about elegant or performance code.
    This is about hacks and tricks in python which help you to shorten your code.
    You don't need to use this in production, but it can help for deep comprehension of Python.
