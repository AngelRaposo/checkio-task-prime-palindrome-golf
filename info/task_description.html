    <p>”Hey, it looks like that list shows a bunch of locations in the library.” Sofia told Stephen. “I wonder what they
        are hiding in these locations.”</p>

    <p>”Probably a bunch of books. Maybe a DVD of some old guys talking about historical revisionism or something. Just
        a guess, it is a Library after all.”</p>

    <p>”Okay WISE GUY, help me find these locations.”</p>

    <p>”Okay, okay, okay. Looks like each number is the location of a book. If we check the book titles maybe they tell
        us -- “</p>

    <p>”A secret message! Look! The first letters of each book in order spell ‘Find the Prime Palindrome.’ The wuh?”</p>

    <p>”It’s a number that’s prime and also resembles a palindrome. You know, like ‘some men interpret nine memos.’ Its
        the same thing front to back.” Nikola said as he walked in on the two studying the new clue.</p>

    <p>”Well then,” Said Sofia. “We’d best figure it out!”

    An integer is said to be a palindrome if it is equal to its reverse in a
    string form. For example, 79197 and 324423 are palindromes. In this task
    you will be given an integer N. You must find the smallest integer <span style="white-space: nowrap"> M &gt;= N</span>
    such that M is a <strong>prime</strong> number and also a <strong>palindrome</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><strong>Input: </strong> N. An integer.</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>A prime palindrome. An integer.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">checkio(31) == 101
checkio(130) == 131
checkio(131) == 131
</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Prime numbers are very useful for many IT sectors (cryptography, mathematical software).
